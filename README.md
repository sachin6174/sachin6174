# Hi, I'm Sachin Kumar ðŸ‘‹  

I am a macOS developer with extensive experience in building robust and innovative solutions. Over the past 2 years, I have contributed to the development of the [SureMDM product](https://www.42gears.com/products/mobile-device-management/suremdm-agent-for-macos-past-releases/), where I worked on an agent application that manages various macOS device-side jobs. When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading Hindi literature, drawing portraits, listening to music, and exploring new ideas.
